### Wizards & Warlocks

50 years ago, The Kingdom of Exalos was a prosperous land, where those born with magic could
freely practice it, but no longer. A new King has taken the throne, and has begun to hunt down
and kill all commoners with magical abilities, including you.

You have been caught by the King's Guards, and await your invetible punishment in the palace
dungeon. Fight your way through the palace with your sorceries and restore peace to Exalos!
